This is a 1D parallel code to solve the linear advection equation for two initial conditions:
    1 - Step Function
    2 - Gaussian function

The code is all contained within one file 'Advection.f90'

A config file is used to setup the simulation in which initial condition, boundary conditions, domain 
CFL, simulation time, and grid points are specified.

The solver scheme can be changed with 5 choices.

As this is a small code there is an option to repeat the whole simulation if averages for the timings
are desired.

To compile:

mpifort Advection.f90 -o Run.sh

To run:

mpirun -np <numprocs> Run.sh

Compiler versions verified on:
openmpi-4.1.4

Note:
Grid points must bed divisible by numprocs
